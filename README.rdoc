== README

Given a Summoner Name, the app will look at which champions have been granted a loot chest and which champions have not.  It will then give a suggestion about which champion should be played next to have the highest chance of getting a loot crate based on mastery and highest grade. For example a champion at level 5 mastery that you have an A+ on would probably be likely for you to get an S- or better on and get a crate.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
